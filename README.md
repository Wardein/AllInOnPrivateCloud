# PrivateCloud
Build greatness using your own data

# Core philosophy
- **Access your data** - It's a cloud, d'uh...
- **Sync your data** - Yeah it will have webdav
- **Share your data** - Mom said its not your turn yet with my data
- **Expandable** - That's the juicy part. Low entry barrier + easy plugin development
- **Security** - Yeah we support https like 95% of websites; maybe we'll do 2FA or other stuff in the future
